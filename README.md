Each problem folder contains:
1. **README.md** → Problem statement, approach, complexity.  
2. **C++ code** → `.cpp` implementation.  
3. **Python code** → `.py` implementation.

## 🏷️ Example Problem Format
Here’s how each problem is documented inside its folder:

### 📌 Two Sum (LeetCode #1)

**Problem Statement**  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

**Approach**  
- Use a hashmap to store numbers and their indices.  
- For each element, check if `target - current` exists in the hashmap.  
- Time: **O(n)**, Space: **O(n)**.  

**Solutions**  
- [two_sum.cpp](Arrays/Two_Sum/two_sum.cpp)  
- [two_sum.py](Arrays/Two_Sum/two_sum.py)
