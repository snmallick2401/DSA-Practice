# Data Structures & Algorithms Journey in C++ and Python

![header](https://capsule-render.vercel.app/api?type=waving&color=auto&height=300&section=header&text=DSA%20Portfolio&fontSize=90)

Welcome to my personal DSA repository! This project is a curated collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in both C++ and Python. It serves as a living document of my journey in mastering fundamental computer science concepts, from basic data structures to advanced algorithms.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* **To Learn:** Actively solve problems to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
* **To Showcase:** Demonstrate my problem-solving skills, coding style, and knowledge of C++ and Python to potential recruiters and peers.
* **To Document:** Create a well-organized reference for myself, complete with explanations and complexity analysis for each problem.

## 🏷️ Example Problem Format
Here’s how each problem is documented inside its folder:

### 📌 Two Sum (LeetCode #1)

**Problem Statement**  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

**Approach**  
- Use a hashmap to store numbers and their indices.  
- For each element, check if `target - current` exists in the hashmap.  
- Time: **O(n)**, Space: **O(n)**.  

**Solutions**  
- [two_sum.cpp](Arrays/Two_Sum/two_sum.cpp)  
- [two_sum.py](Arrays/Two_Sum/two_sum.py)
